# Blog_App
----------------------------
###  Installation
Blog App requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run.

You must have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed in your computer. Then follow these steps:


Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd BlogApp
```
```sh
$ npm install 
```
```sh
$ node app.js
```
Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in your preferred browser.
```sh
http://localhost:3000/

> **Tip**: Changes to the html, css and js files may not reflect immediately in the browser because of caching. It is advisable to install a browser extension that clears the cache for you.
